# SpringRewards


1. Wrote the controller to calculate the Rewards - BootController
2. To run it. Just Run the app as Springboot app. 
3. Handled using the try catch blocks
4. Sample end point - //http://localhost:9090/calculaterewards?amount=101
5. I tried to use the lombok but some reason my local setup has an issue. So, I just put annotations just for your reference.
